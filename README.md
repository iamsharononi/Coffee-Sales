## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing coffee sales data to uncover insights into product performance, regional sales patterns, and overall revenue drivers. The goal is to provide actionable insights for decision-makers in the coffee retail sector by leveraging data analysis techniques.

## 2. Story of Data
The data contains sales transactions for various coffee products such as Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino, and others. It captures the following key metrics: product category, region, sales quantity, unit price, and total sales value. The scope of the dataset spans multiple regions, offering a broad perspective on how different products perform across different markets.

## 3. Data Preprocessing & Splitting
The dataset required some basic preprocessing steps:

. Removed any empty rows and columns.
. Ensured consistent formatting of product names and region names.
. Calculated total sales where necessary using the formula Total Sales = Quantity Sold x Unit Price.
. Verified data integrity by cross-checking quantities and prices._

## 4. Pre-Analysis Observations
Initial exploration of the data revealed:

. Certain products, like Espresso and Latte, are consistently top sellers.
. Some regions show significantly higher sales volumes than others.
. Price points vary across products, with premium products like Cappuccino and Mocha commanding higher unit prices.

## 5. In-Analysis
Using pivot tables and charts in Excel, key insights include:

. Regional Performance: The East region recorded the highest sales volumes, while the South region lagged behind.
. Product Performance: Espresso led in total quantity sold but Latte generated higher total revenue due to a higher price point.
. Revenue Drivers: Total sales are driven more by quantity in certain regions, while in others, premium pricing strategies play a bigger role.

Dashboards were created to visualize:
. Sales by product category.
. Sales by region.
. Comparison of quantity sold vs. total revenue.

## 6. Post-Analysis & Key Insights
. Focusing marketing efforts on the East and West regions could maximize returns.
. Introducing bundle offers for Espresso and Cappuccino may help increase average transaction value.
. The South region needs a different strategy, possibly centered around pricing adjustments or product education campaigns.

## 7. Data Visualizations
The following visualizations were created using Excel:

. Bar chart of sales by product category.
. Pie chart of total sales distribution by region.
. Combo chart comparing quantity sold and total sales across products.
